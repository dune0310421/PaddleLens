([#&#8203;2675](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2675))\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   Fix optional percent-encoding behaviour. ([#&#8203;2671](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2671))\n-   More robust checking for opening upload files in binary mode. ([#&#8203;2630](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2630))\n-   Properly support IP addresses in `NO_PROXY` environment variable. ([#&#8203;2659](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2659))\n-   Set default file for `NetRCAuth()` to `None` to use the stdlib default. ([#&#8203;2667](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2667))\n-   Set logging request lines to INFO level for async requests, in line with sync requests. ([#&#8203;2656](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2656))\n-   Fix which gen-delims need to be escaped for path/query/fragment components in URL. ([#&#8203;2701](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2701))\n\n### [`v0.24.0`](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0240-6th-April-2023)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/compare/0.23.3...0.24.0)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   The logging behaviour has been changed to be more in-line with other standard Python logging usages. We no longer have a custom `TRACE` log level, and we no longer use the `HTTPX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to auto-configure logging. We now have a significant amount of `DEBUG` logging available at the network level. Full documentation is available at https://www.python-httpx.org/logging/ ([#&#8203;2547](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2547), [encode/httpcore#648](https://togithub.com/encode/httpcore/issues/648))\n-   The `Response.iter_lines()` method now matches the stdlib behaviour and does not include the newline characters. It also resolves a performance issue. ([#&#8203;2423](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2423))\n-   Query parameter encoding switches from using + for spaces and %2F for forward slash, to instead using %20 for spaces and treating forward slash as a safe, unescaped character. This differs from `requests`, but is in line with browser behavior in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Both options are RFC valid. ([#&#8203;2543](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2543))\n-   NetRC authentication is no longer automatically handled, but is instead supported by an explicit `httpx.NetRCAuth()` authentication class. See the documentation at https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#netrc-support ([#&#8203;2525](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2525))\n\n##### Removed\n\n-   The `rfc3986` dependancy has been removed. ([#&#8203;2252](https://togithub.com/encode/httpx/issues/2252))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n👻 **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

These issues have now been fixed, and\nthis release should come with compiled wheels once again.\n\nThere will be no wheels for Python 3.12 due to a bug in mypyc. We will provide 3.12\nwheels in a future release as soon as the mypyc bug is fixed.\n\n##### Packaging\n\n-   Upgrade to mypy 1.5.1 ([#&#8203;3864](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3864))\n\n##### Performance\n\n-   Store raw tuples instead of NamedTuples in Black's cache, improving performance and\n    decreasing the size of the cache ([#&#8203;3877](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3877))\n\n### [`v23.9.0`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#2390)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/23.7.0...23.9.0)\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   More concise formatting for dummy implementations ([#&#8203;3796](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3796))\n-   In stub files, add a blank line between a statement with a body (e.g an\n    `if sys.version_info > (3, x):`) and a function definition on the same level ([#&#8203;3862](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3862))\n-   Fix a bug whereby spaces were removed from walrus operators within subscript([#&#8203;3823](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3823))\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   Black now applies exclusion and ignore logic before resolving symlinks ([#&#8203;3846](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3846))\n\n##### Performance\n\n-   Avoid importing `IPython` if notebook cells do not contain magics ([#&#8203;3782](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3782))\n-   Improve caching by comparing file hashes as fallback for mtime and size ([#&#8203;3821](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3821))\n\n##### *Blackd*\n\n-   Fix an issue in `blackd` with single character input ([#&#8203;3558](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3558))\n\n##### Integrations\n\n-   Black now has an\n    [official pre-commit mirror](https://togithub.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror). Swapping\n    `https://github.com/psf/black` to `https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror` in\n    your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will make Black about 2x faster ([#&#8203;3828](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3828))\n-   The `.black.env` folder specified by `ENV_PATH` will now be removed on the completion\n    of the GitHub Action ([#&#8203;3759](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3759))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>RobertCraigie/pyright-python (pyright)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.1.326`](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python/compare/v1.1.325...v1.1.326)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python/compare/v1.1.325...v1.1.326)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>pytest-dev/pytest (pytest)</summary>\n\n### [`v7.4.2`](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases/tag/7.4.2): pytest 7.4.2 (2023-09-07)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/compare/7.4.1...7.4.2)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n-   [#&#8203;11237](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11237): Fix doctest collection of `functools.cached_property` objects.\n\n-   [#&#8203;11306](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11306): Fixed bug using `--importmode=importlib` which would cause package `__init__.py` files to be imported more than once in some cases.\n\n-   [#&#8203;11367](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11367): Fixed bug where `user_properties` where not being saved in the JUnit XML file if a fixture failed during teardown.\n\n-   [#&#8203;11394](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11394): Fixed crash when parsing long command line arguments that might be interpreted as files.\n\n### Improved Documentation\n\n-   [#&#8203;11391](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11391): Improved disclaimer on pytest plugin reference page to better indicate this is an automated, non-curated listing.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n👻 **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

Please try it out and\n[share your feedback](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4042).\n\nThis release (23.12.0) will still produce the 2023 style. Most but not all of the\nchanges in `--preview` mode will be in the 2024 stable style.\n\n##### Stable style\n\n-   Fix bug where `# fmt: off` automatically dedents when used with the `--line-ranges`\n    option, even when it is not within the specified line range. ([#&#8203;4084](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4084))\n-   Fix feature detection for parenthesized context managers ([#&#8203;4104](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4104))\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   Prefer more equal signs before a break when splitting chained assignments ([#&#8203;4010](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4010))\n-   Standalone form feed characters at the module level are no longer removed ([#&#8203;4021](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4021))\n-   Additional cases of immediately nested tuples, lists, and dictionaries are now\n    indented less ([#&#8203;4012](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4012))\n-   Allow empty lines at the beginning of all blocks, except immediately before a\n    docstring ([#&#8203;4060](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4060))\n-   Fix crash in preview mode when using a short `--line-length` ([#&#8203;4086](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4086))\n-   Keep suites consisting of only an ellipsis on their own lines if they are not\n    functions or class definitions ([#&#8203;4066](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4066)) ([#&#8203;4103](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4103))\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   `--line-ranges` now skips *Black*'s internal stability check in `--safe` mode. This\n    avoids a crash on rare inputs that have many unformatted same-content lines. ([#&#8203;4034](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4034))\n\n##### Packaging\n\n-   Upgrade to mypy 1.7.1 ([#&#8203;4049](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4049)) ([#&#8203;4069](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4069))\n-   Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.12 ([#&#8203;4070](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4070))\n\n##### Integrations\n\n-   Enable 3.12 CI ([#&#8203;4035](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4035))\n-   Build docker images in parallel ([#&#8203;4054](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4054))\n-   Build docker images with 3.12 ([#&#8203;4055](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4055))\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>pycqa/isort (isort)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.13.2`](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#5132-December-13-2023)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/compare/5.13.1...5.13.2)\n\n-   Apply the bracket fix from issue [#&#8203;471](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/471) only for use_parentheses=True ([#&#8203;2184](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/2184)) [@&#8203;bp72](https://togithub.com/bp72)\n    -   Confine pre-commit to stages ([#&#8203;2213](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/2213)) [@&#8203;davidculley](https://togithub.com/davidculley)\n    -   Fixed colors extras ([#&#8203;2212](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/2212)) [@&#8203;staticdev](https://togithub.com/staticdev)\n\n### [`v5.13.1`](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#5131-December-11-2023)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/compare/5.13.0...5.13.1)\n\n-   Fixed integration tests ([#&#8203;2208](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/2208)) [@&#8203;bp72](https://togithub.com/bp72)\n    -   Fixed normalizing imports from more than one level of parent modules (issue/2152) ([#&#8203;2191](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/2191)) [@&#8203;bp72](https://togithub.com/bp72)\n    -   Remove optional dependencies without extras ([#&#8203;2207](https://togithub.com/pycqa/isort/issues/2207)) [@&#8203;staticdev](https://togithub.com/staticdev)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>pre-commit/pre-commit (pre-commit)</summary>\n\n### [`v3.6.0`](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#360---2023-12-09)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/compare/v3.5.0...v3.6.0)\n\n\\==================\n\n##### Features\n\n-   Check `minimum_pre_commit_version` first when parsing configs.\n    -   [#&#8203;3092](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/3092) PR by [@&#8203;asottile](https://togithub.com/asottile).\n\n##### Fixes\n\n-   Fix deprecation warnings for `importlib.resources`.\n    -   [#&#8203;3043](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/3043) PR by [@&#8203;asottile](https://togithub.com/asottile).\n-   Fix deprecation warnings for rmtree.\n    -   [#&#8203;3079](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/3079) PR by [@&#8203;edgarrmondragon](https://togithub.com/edgarrmondragon).\n\n##### Updating\n\n-   Drop support for python<3.9.\n    -   [#&#8203;3042](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/3042) PR by [@&#8203;asottile](https://togithub.com/asottile).\n    -   [#&#8203;3093](https://togithub.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/3093) PR by [@&#8203;asottile](https://togithub.com/asottile).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>RobertCraigie/pyright-python (pyright)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.1.341`](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python/compare/v1.1.340...v1.1.341)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python/compare/v1.1.340...v1.1.341)\n\n### [`v1.1.340`](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python/compare/v1.1.339...v1.1.340)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python/compare/v1.1.339...v1.1.340)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n👻 **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

Try them out and\n[share your feedback](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues). In the past, the preview\nstyle has included some features that we were not able to stabilize. This year, we're\nadding a separate `--unstable` style for features with known problems. Now, the\n`--preview` style only includes features that we actually expect to make it into next\nyear's stable style.\n\n##### Stable style\n\nSeveral bug fixes were made in features that are moved to the stable style in this\nrelease:\n\n-   Fix comment handling when parenthesising conditional expressions ([#&#8203;4134](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4134))\n-   Fix bug where spaces were not added around parenthesized walruses in subscripts,\n    unlike other binary operators ([#&#8203;4109](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4109))\n-   Remove empty lines before docstrings in async functions ([#&#8203;4132](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4132))\n-   Address a missing case in the change to allow empty lines at the beginning of all\n    blocks, except immediately before a docstring ([#&#8203;4130](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4130))\n-   For stubs, fix logic to enforce empty line after nested classes with bodies ([#&#8203;4141](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4141))\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   Add `--unstable` style, covering preview features that have known problems that would\n    block them from going into the stable style. Also add the `--enable-unstable-feature`\n    flag; for example, use\n    `--enable-unstable-feature hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` to apply this\n    preview feature throughout 2024, even if a later Black release downgrades the feature\n    to unstable ([#&#8203;4096](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4096))\n-   Format module docstrings the same as class and function docstrings ([#&#8203;4095](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4095))\n-   Fix crash when using a walrus in a dictionary ([#&#8203;4155](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4155))\n-   Fix unnecessary parentheses when wrapping long dicts ([#&#8203;4135](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4135))\n-   Stop normalizing spaces before `# fmt: skip` comments ([#&#8203;4146](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4146))\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   Print warning when configuration in `pyproject.toml` contains an invalid key ([#&#8203;4165](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4165))\n-   Fix symlink handling, properly ignoring symlinks that point outside of root ([#&#8203;4161](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4161))\n-   Fix cache mtime logic that resulted in false positive cache hits ([#&#8203;4128](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4128))\n-   Remove the long-deprecated `--experimental-string-processing` flag. This feature can\n    currently be enabled with `--preview --enable-unstable-feature string_processing`.\n    ([#&#8203;4096](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4096))\n\n##### Integrations\n\n-   Revert the change to run Black's pre-commit integration only on specific git hooks\n    ([#&#8203;3940](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3940)) for better compatibility with older versions of pre-commit ([#&#8203;4137](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4137))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This option accepts either `\"w\"` or `\"a\"` and defaults to `\"w\"`.\n\n    Previously, the mode was hard-coded to be `\"w\"` which truncates the file before logging.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12047](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12047): When multiple finalizers of a fixture raise an exception, now all exceptions are reported as an exception group.\n    Previously, only the first exception was reported.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n-   [#&#8203;11904](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904): Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 that would cause test collection to fail due to permission errors when using `--pyargs`.\n\n    This change improves the collection tree for tests specified using `--pyargs`, see `12043`{.interpreted-text role=\"pull\"} for a comparison with pytest 8.0 and <8.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12011](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12011): Fixed a regression in 8.0.1 whereby `setup_module` xunit-style fixtures are not executed when `--doctest-modules` is passed.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12014](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12014): Fix the `stacklevel` used when warning about marks used on fixtures.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12039](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12039): Fixed a regression in `8.0.2` where tests created using `tmp_path`{.interpreted-text role=\"fixture\"} have been collected multiple times in CI under Windows.\n\n## Improved Documentation\n\n-   [#&#8203;11790](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11790): Documented the retention of temporary directories created using the `tmp_path` fixture in more detail.\n\n## Trivial/Internal Changes\n\n-   [#&#8203;11785](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11785): Some changes were made to private functions which may affect plugins which access them:\n    -   `FixtureManager._getautousenames()` now takes a `Node` itself instead of the nodeid.\n    -   `FixtureManager.getfixturedefs()` now takes the `Node` itself instead of the nodeid.\n    -   The `_pytest.nodes.iterparentnodeids()` function is removed without replacement.\n        Prefer to traverse the node hierarchy itself instead.\n        If you really need to, copy the function from the previous pytest release.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n👻 **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.

This option accepts either `\"w\"` or `\"a\"` and defaults to `\"w\"`.\n\n    Previously, the mode was hard-coded to be `\"w\"` which truncates the file before logging.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12047](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12047): When multiple finalizers of a fixture raise an exception, now all exceptions are reported as an exception group.\n    Previously, only the first exception was reported.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n-   [#&#8203;11475](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475): Fixed regression where `--importmode=importlib` would import non-test modules more than once.\n\n-   [#&#8203;11904](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904): Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 that would cause test collection to fail due to permission errors when using `--pyargs`.\n\n    This change improves the collection tree for tests specified using `--pyargs`, see `12043`{.interpreted-text role=\"pull\"} for a comparison with pytest 8.0 and <8.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12011](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12011): Fixed a regression in 8.0.1 whereby `setup_module` xunit-style fixtures are not executed when `--doctest-modules` is passed.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12014](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12014): Fix the `stacklevel` used when warning about marks used on fixtures.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12039](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12039): Fixed a regression in `8.0.2` where tests created using `tmp_path`{.interpreted-text role=\"fixture\"} have been collected multiple times in CI under Windows.\n\n## Improved Documentation\n\n-   [#&#8203;11790](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11790): Documented the retention of temporary directories created using the `tmp_path` fixture in more detail.\n\n## Trivial/Internal Changes\n\n-   [#&#8203;11785](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11785): Some changes were made to private functions which may affect plugins which access them:\n\n    -   `FixtureManager._getautousenames()` now takes a `Node` itself instead of the nodeid.\n    -   `FixtureManager.getfixturedefs()` now takes the `Node` itself instead of the nodeid.\n    -   The `_pytest.nodes.iterparentnodeids()` function is removed without replacement.\n        Prefer to traverse the node hierarchy itself instead.\n        If you really need to, copy the function from the previous pytest release.\n\n-   [#&#8203;12069](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069): Delayed the deprecation of the following features to `9.0.0`:\n\n    -   `node-ctor-fspath-deprecation`{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}.\n    -   `legacy-path-hooks-deprecated`{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}.\n\n    It was discovered after `8.1.0` was released that the warnings about the impeding removal were not being displayed, so the team decided to revert the removal.\n\n    This is the reason for `8.1.0` being yanked.\n\n# pytest 8.1.0 (YANKED)\n\n::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::\n\nThis release has been **yanked**: it broke some plugins without the proper warning period, due to\nsome warnings not showing up as expected.\n\nSee [#&#8203;12069](https://togithub.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069).\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n👻 **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.
